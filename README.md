**Advanced Prompting Engine**

* Incorporates your target SEO keywords naturally
* Matches your brand's unique voice and tone
* Speaks directly to your target audience
* Formats beautifully with headers, bullet points, and emphasis

This isn't simple prompt templating – it's a professional system developed through extensive testing. The AI understands e-commerce psychology and writes copy that **actually sells**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this really free? No hidden costs? =

**Yes!** CopySpell AI can work with free API keys from Google and Groq. There are no premium tiers, no monthly subscriptions. Our Smart AI Routing™ technology maximizes your free API usage by intelligently switching between models.

= How is CopySpell AI different from other AI plugins? =

Other plugins require paid AI subscriptions (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, etc.) or charge you per generation. CopySpell AI is the **only plugin** that works entirely on free API tiers thanks to our Smart AI Routing™ technology. Plus, we offer intelligent refinement suggestions, marketing tools, full content history, and true background bulk processing.

= What is Smart AI Routing™? =

It's our proprietary technology that automatically routes your requests through multiple free AI models. If Google Gemini hits its rate limit, it tries Groq. If that's busy, it tries another model. The system keeps cycling until you get a quality response – all using free tiers.

= Do I need to pay for AI services? =

**No!** Get free API keys from:
* **Google AI Studio** (aistudio.google.com) – Free Gemini API access
* **Groq Console** (console.groq.com) – Free access to multiple fast models

Both take about 2 minutes to set up. No credit card required.

= How many products can I process? =

**Unlimited.** Bulk processing runs in the background using WordPress Action Scheduler. Start a job with 10,000 products, close your browser, and come back later – it keeps running. The system processes in batches to respect API rate limits while maximizing throughput.

= Will bulk processing slow down my website? =

**Not at all.** Background processing is completely asynchronous. Your site visitors won't notice any slowdown. You can even close your browser and the job continues running on your server.

= Can I keep different versions of generated content? =

**Yes!** CopySpell AI automatically saves a complete history of all generated content. Compare versions, restore previous revisions, or track how your descriptions evolved over time. Perfect for A/B testing different approaches.

= What are refinement suggestions? =

After generating content, CopySpell AI offers intelligent, contextual suggestions to improve it. These aren't generic options – the AI analyzes your specific content and suggests targeted improvements like "emphasize the eco-friendly aspect" or "add more urgency." One click applies the refinement.

= Can I generate marketing content too? =

**Absolutely!** Generate platform-specific content for:
* Social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter)
* Advertisements (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, YouTube, TikTok)
* Email newsletters and blog posts

Each piece is tailored to the platform's best practices and audience expectations.

= What languages are supported? =

Generate content in 30+ languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Greek, and many more.

= How does the AI know about my products? =

CopySpell AI reads your product's existing data – title, current description, attributes, categories, tags, price, and images. It uses this information to generate relevant, accurate content. You can also add custom keywords and features.

= Is my data secure? =

**Yes.** Here's exactly what happens:
1. Your API keys are encrypted before storage in your WordPress database
2. When you generate content, your product data is sent to our server
3. Our server calls the AI providers using YOUR keys and returns the response
4. **We do not store any of your product data** – it's processed and immediately discarded
5. We only keep basic logs (domain name, timestamp) for troubleshooting – no content, no personal data

= What happens if all AI models are rate-limited? =

Smart AI Routing™ tries multiple models in sequence. In the rare case all models are temporarily rate-limited, the system waits and retries. For bulk processing, failed items are automatically retried in the next batch.

= Privacy Policy =

CopySpell AI is designed with your privacy in mind. Here's exactly how your data is handled:

**How It Works:**
When you generate content, your product data is sent to our proxy server at copyspell.actusanima.com. Our server then calls the AI providers using your API keys and returns the response to you.

**We Do Not Store Your Data.**

* **Your product data:** Processed in memory and immediately discarded.
* **Your API keys:** NOT stored on our server. They are encrypted in YOUR WordPress database and only transmitted during API calls.
* **Server logs:** We keep basic logs containing only the calling domain name and timestamp for troubleshooting purposes. No content, no personal data, no product information.

**Why a Proxy Server?**
The proxy architecture enables our Smart AI Routing™ technology to work efficiently and allows us to maintain and update AI model sequences without requiring plugin updates.

**Third-Party Services:**
Your product data is sent to AI providers for content generation. Please review their privacy policies:
* [Google AI Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* [Groq Privacy Policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy/)
